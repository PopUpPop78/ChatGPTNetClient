Create a python app to call a webservice


To create a python app to call a webservice, we will need to follow these steps:

1. Import necessary libraries:
First, we need to import the necessary libraries (requests, json) to make the webservice call and handle the response data.

2. Set the webservice URL:
Next, we need to set the URL of the webservice that we want to call.

3. Define request parameters:
If the webservice requires any specific parameters or headers, we need to define them in the code.

4. Make the webservice call:
We can use the requests library to make the webservice call. We will need to pass in the URL, parameters, and headers (if any) as the function parameters.

5. Handle the response:
Once we receive the response from the webservice, we need to handle it based on the format (JSON, XML, etc.). If the response is in JSON format, we can use the json library to convert it to a python dictionary.

6. Perform desired operations:
We can now perform the desired operations on the response data, such as extracting specific information, displaying it, or saving it to a file.

7. Error handling:
We need to handle any possible errors that may occur during the webservice call, such as incorrect URL or parameter values, server errors, etc.

8. Run the app:
Lastly, we can run our python app to call the webservice and execute the desired operations.

Example code:

```
import requests
import json

#set the webservice URL
url = "https://example.com/webservice"

#define request parameters
params = {'param1': 'value1', 'param2': 'value2'}
headers = {'Authorization': 'API_TOKEN'}

#make the webservice call
response = requests.get(url, params=params, headers=headers)

#handle the response data
if response.status_code == 200:
    #convert response to python dictionary
    data = json.loads(response.text)

    #perform desired operations on data
    print(data)
else:
    print("Error:", response.status_code)

#handle errors
except requests.exceptions.Timeout:
    print("Error: Timeout")
except requests.exceptions.TooManyRedirects:
    print("Error: Too many redirects")
except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
    print("Error:", e)
```

Note: The exact code may vary depending on the specific webservice and its requirements. It is important to read the webservice's documentation for specific instructions on how to make the call 
and handle the response data.
